## Improving Weapons
There are 8 major weapon types, common to 4 different drivers. I tried ballancing driver efectiveness in battle by dividing them into 4 different levels of weapon proficiency. Originally, it looks like this:

| Original | GreatAxe | MegaLance | E.Cannon | S.Hammer | C.Katana | T.Rings | BitBall | K.Claws |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Best Driver | Zeke | Morag | Zeke | Morag | Morag | Rex | Zeke | Zeke |
| Good Driver | Morag | Rex | Nia | Zeke | Rex | Morag | Nia | Nia |
| Ok Driver | Rex | Nia | Rex | Rex | Nia | Nia | Morag | Rex |
| Worst Driver | Nia | Zeke | Morag | Nia | Zeke | Zeke | Rex | Morag |

As is, Zeke is the best driver for 4 different weapons, and Nia is not the best Driver for any Weapons.
Upon change, I strived for an avarege of 2 weapons in each proficiency level for each driver, reaching the following chart

|    Updated   | GreatAxe | MegaLance | E.Cannon | S.Hammer | C.Katana | T.Rings | BitBall | K.Claws |
|:------------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
|  Best Driver |   Zeke   |    **Rex↑**   |   **Nia↑**   |   Morag  |    Nia   |  **Nia↑↑**  |   Zeke  |   Nia↑  |
|  Good Driver |   Morag  |   **Morag↓**  |   **Zeke↓**  |   Zeke   |    Rex   |   **Rex↓**  |   Nia   |   Zeke  |
|   Ok Driver  |    Rex   |    Nia    |    Rex   |    Rex   |    Nia   |  **Morag↓** |  Morag  |   Rex   |
| Worst Driver |    Nia   |    Zeke   |   Morag  |    Nia   |   Zeke   |   Zeke  |   Rex   |  Morag  |

Just by improving a few drivers and having them ascend the list, the chart looks much more balanced

## Details
**Shield Hammers**

All Drivers:
Hammers now might be faster than the monado, but they really needed some buffs to be even viable. Monado comes with lots of other numerous advantadges over the hammer, so I think it's still in a very good spot.
